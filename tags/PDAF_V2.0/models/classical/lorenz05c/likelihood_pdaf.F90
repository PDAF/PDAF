! !ROUTINE: likelihood_pdaf --- Compute the likelihood for an ensemble member
!
! !INTERFACE:
SUBROUTINE likelihood_pdaf(step, dim_obs, obs, resid, likely)

! !DESCRIPTION:
! User-supplied routine for PDAF (NETF):
!
! The routine is called during the analysis step.
! It has to compute the likelihood of the
! ensemble according to the difference from the
! observation (residual) and the error distribution
! of the observations.
!
! In general this routine is similar to the routine
! prodRinvA used for ensemble square root Kalman
! filters. As an addition to this routine, we here have
! to evaluate the likelihood weight according the
! assumed observation error statistics.
!
! This variant is for the Lorenz05c model without
! parallelization. We assume a diagonal observation
! error covariance matrix with constant variances. 
! Thus, the product can be implemented efficiently 
! as a scaling of each element of the input matrix
! by the inverse variance.
