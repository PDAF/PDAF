Collection of template routines for PDAF user routines

Directories:

offline_omi/ 
- offline coupling using OMI

online_omi/
- online coupling using OMI in fully parallel mode

online_omi_flexible/ 
- online coupling using OMI in flexible parallelization mode (more complex to implement)

omi/
- templates just for OMI (file with callback routines, observation module, observation operator)

classical/
- classical implementation not using OMI


Note: The templates for the OMI variant all contain a Makefile and main program. For the two online cases the main program should only be used for testing the compilation. In an implementation with a real model, it will be replaced by the actual model program main.
