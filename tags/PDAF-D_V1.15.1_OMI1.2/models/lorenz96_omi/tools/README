Tool programs for the Lorenz96 model.

This directory contains the source code of two programs:

generate_obs.F90
The program generates synthetic observations by reading a state
trajectory and adding random Gaussian noise with a specified 
standard deviation. The observation are written into a NetCDF file.

generate_covar.F90
This program generates a covariance matrix from a state trajectory.
the matrix is computed from the perturbation matrix about the long
time mean state by a singular value decomposition. Stored are the 
singular values and singular vectors as well as the mean state.

runmodel.sh
This is a script to run the Lorenz96 forward model (compiled 
by 'make lorenz_96' without setting CPP_DEFS=-DUSE_PDAF in the 
include file.) Th emodel is run for 10000. The output can build 
the basis for the test runs with runasml.sh (after generating files
for the covariance matrix and the observations).

runasml.sh
This is a script to run a set of 11 short assiilation experiments.
the resulting mean RMS errors can be plotted with Matlab using the
script plot_example.m in the directory plotting/.
