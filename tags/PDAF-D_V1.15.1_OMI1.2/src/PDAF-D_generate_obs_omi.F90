! !ROUTINE: PDAF_generate_obsomi --- Interface to transfer state to PDAF
!
! !INTERFACE:
SUBROUTINE PDAF_generate_obs_omi(collect_state_pdaf, distribute_state_pdaf, &
       init_dim_obs_f_pdaf, obs_op_f_pdaf, get_obs_f_pdaf, prepoststep_pdaf, &
       next_observation_pdaf, outflag)

! !DESCRIPTION:
! Interface routine called from the model during the 
! forecast of each ensemble state to transfer data
! from the model to PDAF and to perform the analysis
! step.
!
! This routine provides the simplified interface
! where names of user-provided subroutines are
! fixed. It simply calls the routine with the
! full interface using pre-defined routine names.
!
! Variant for gnerating observations with domain
! decomposition.
!
! !  This is a core routine of PDAF and
!    should not be changed by the user   !
!

! 2019-01 - Lars Nerger - Initial code
! Later revisions - see svn log
