! !MODULE:
MODULE mod_assimilation

! !DESCRIPTION:
! This module provides variables needed for the 
! assimilation within the routines of the dummy model.
! For simplicity, all assimilation-related variables
! are stored here, even if they are only used in
! the main program for the filter initialization.
! Most variables can be specified as a command line 
! argument.

! !REVISION HISTORY:
