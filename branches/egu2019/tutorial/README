This directory is part of PDAF - the Parallel Data Assimilation Framework.
It contains an implementations of the offline and online modes of PDAF
with a simple 2-dimensional model setup.

This is a tutorial version prepared for the Short course
"Data assimilation in the geosciences - Practical data assimilation with
the Parallel Data Assimilation Framework" and includes less examples.

The implementation is described in detail in the tutorials that are available
on the web site of PDAF (http://pdaf.awi.de).

The directories are as follows:

---- Input files ----

inputs_online/
This directory contains input files to execute the example programs for the
online mode of PDAF.


---- ONLINE mode ----

online_2d_serialmodel/
contains an implementation of the online mode of PDAF with a serial 
(i.e. non-parallelized) model.  Only the ensemble integration is performed
in parallel, while each model and the filter are each executed using a 
single process.

online_2d_serialmodel.noMPI/
contains an implementation of the online mode of PDAF with a serial 
(i.e. non-parallelized) model using the flexible online implementation
method. Here it is implemented for use without parallelization.
