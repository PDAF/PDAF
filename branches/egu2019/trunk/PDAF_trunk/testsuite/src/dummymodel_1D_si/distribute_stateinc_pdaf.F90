! !ROUTINE: distribute_stateinc_pdaf --- Add analysis increment to model fields
!
! !INTERFACE:
SUBROUTINE distribute_stateinc_pdaf(dim_p, state_inc_p, first, steps)

! !DESCRIPTION:
! User-supplied routine for PDAF.
! Used in the filters: SEEK/SEIK/EnKF/LSEIK/ETKF/LETKF/ESTKF/LESTKF
!
! This subroutine is called during the forecast 
! phase of the filter from PDAF\_incremental
! supplying the analysis state increment.
! The routine has to compute the fraction of 
! the increment to be added to the model state 
! at each time step. Further, it has to transform 
! the increment vector into increments of the 
! fields of the model (typically available 
! trough a module).
!
! The routine is executed by each process that 
! is participating in the model integrations.
!
! For the dummy model and PDAF with domain 
! decomposition the state vector and the model 
! field are identical. The increment vector 
! divided by the number of time steps in the 
! forecast phase is added to the model field.
