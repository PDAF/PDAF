!> PDAF-OMI template observation module 
!!
!! This module handles operations for one data type (called 'module-type' below).
!! 
!! The subroutines in this module are for the particular handling of
!! a single observation type.
!! The routines are called by the different call-back routines of PDAF.
!! Most of the routines are generic so that in practice only 2 routines
!! need to be adapted for a particular data type. These are the routines
!! for the initialization of the observation information (init_dim_obs)
!! and for the observation operator (obs_op).
!!
!! The module and the routines are named according to the observation type.
!! This allows to distinguish the observation type and the routines in this
!! module from other observation types.
!!
!! The module uses two derived data types (obs_f and obs_l), which contain
!! all information about the full and local observations. Only variables
!! of the type obs_f need to be initialized in this module. The variables
!! in the type obs_l are initilized by the generic routines from PDAFomi.
!!
!!
!! **Using this template:**
!!   To be able to distinguish the observation type and the routines in this module,
!!   we recommend to rename the module according to the observation module-type.
!!   Further,we recommend to replace 'TYPE' in the routine names according to the
!!   type of the observation so that they can be identified when calling them from 
!!   the call-back routines.
!!
!!
!! These 2 routines need to be adapted for the particular observation type:
!! * init_dim_obs_OBSTYPE \n
!!           Count number of process-local and full observations; 
!!           initialize vector of observations and their inverse variances;
!!           initialize coordinate array and index array for indices of
!!           observed elements of the state vector.
!! * obs_op_OBSTYPE \n
!!           Observation operator to get full observation vector of this type. Here
!!           one has to choose a proper observation operator or implement one.
!!
!! In addition, there are two optional routine, which are required if filters 
!! with localization are used:
!! * init_dim_obs_l_OBSTYPE \n
!!           Only required if domain-localized filters (e.g. LESTKF, LETKF) are used:
!!           Count number of local observations of module-type according to
!!           their coordinates (distance from local analysis domain). Initialize
!!           module-internal distances and index arrays.
!! * localize_covar_OBSTYPE \n
!!           Only required if the localized EnKF is used:
!!           Apply covariance localization in the LEnKF.
!!
!! For 3D-Var methods two additional observation operators are required
!! * obs_op_lin_OBSTYPE \n
!!           Linearized observation operator for this type. Since OMI currently
!!           includes only linear observation operators this routine can be identical 
!!           to obs_op_OBSTYPE (or one can call obs_op_OBSTYPE directly in
!!           obs_op_lin_pdafomi in callback_ob_pdafomi.F90
!!           one has to choose a proper observation operator or implement one.
!! * obs_op_adj_OBSTYPE \n
!!           Adjoint observation operator for this type. Here one has to 
!!           choose a proper adjiont observation operator or implement one. 
!!           PDAF-OMI provides an adjoint operator for all of its forward
!!           operators.

!> Initialize information on the module-type observation

  ! The initialization is done locally for each process sub-domain and later

  ! Examples:
  ! 1. If the observations are model fields located at grid points, one should

  !   the indices of the observed field values in the process-local state vector
  !   (state_p). Then one can use the observation operator OBS_OP_GRIDPOINT 
  !   provided by the module PDAFomi.
  ! 2. If the observations are the average of model fields located at grid points,
  !   one should initialize the index array thisobs%id_obs_p with as many rows as 
  !   values to be averaged. Each column of the arrays then contains the indices of
  !   the elements of the process-local state vector that have to be averaged. With
  !   this index array one can then use the observation operator OBS_OP_GRIDAVG
  !   provided by the module PDAFomi.
  ! 3. If model values need to be interpolated to the observation location
  !   one should initialize the index array thisobs%id_obs_p with as many rows as 
  !   values are required in the interpolationto be averaged. Each column of the 
  !   array then contains the indices of elements of the process-local state vector 
  !   that are used in the interpolation.
  ! Below, you need to replace NROWS by the number of required rows
  ! Note: This array is only used in the observation operator routines. If you
  !   replace the observation operator routines provided by PDAF-OMI by a custom
  !   observation operator, you might not need this array.

!! One can choose a proper adjont observation operator

!! implement another observation operator here.
