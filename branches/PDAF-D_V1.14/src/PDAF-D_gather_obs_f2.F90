! !ROUTINE: PDAF_gather_obs_f2 --- Gather a full observation array
!
! !INTERFACE:
SUBROUTINE PDAF_gather_obs_f2(coords_p, coords_f, nrows, status)

! !DESCRIPTION:
! If the local filter is used with a domain-decomposed model,
! the observational information from different sub-domains
! has to be combined into the full observation vector. 
! In this routine the process-local parts of a coordinate array
! accompanying the observation vector are gathered into a full
! array of coordinates. 
! The routine is for the case that the observation coordinates
! are stored column-wise, i.e. each column is the set of coordinates
! for one observation. This should be the usual case, as in this
! case the set of coordinates of one observations are stored
! next to each other in memory. If the coordinates are stored row-
! wise, the routine PDAF_gather_obs_f can be used, but has to be
! called separately for each column. 
!
! !  This is a core routine of PDAF and
!    should not be changed by the user   !
