This file explains how to use the CG+ code.  CG+ is a Conjugate Gradient code used
for solving nonlinear, unconstrained optimization problems.

The following files are contained in this directory:

  Readme	- User guide.
  main.f	- Driver for the optimization code.
  cgfam.f	- Subroutine which implements the main optimization code.
  cgsearch.f	- Subroutine which implements the line search routine for the 
                  code.
  blas.f	- Subroutine which contains all the BLAS routines used in the
                  code.  These routines carry out simple linear algebra
		  vector operations.
  fcn.f		- Subroutine which, given an input vector, x, returns the
		  function, f, and gradient, g, for the function you want to
		  minimize.  As an example the file is initially created to
                  compute the Rosenbrock function and it's gradient.  However,
                  whatever function you are hoping to minimize can be 
                  substituted in this subroutine.
  timer.f	- Subroutine which is used to calculate the amount of time it
		  takes for the optimization algorithm to converge.
  makefile	- Compiles and links code.  Creates an executable called 'main'.

To set up the code to minimize a particular function you need to specify the
following variables in 'main.f':

  n		- number of variables
  x		- the initial input vector
  method	- Conjugate Gradient method used to solve the problem
		  1 : Fletcher-Reeves
		  2 : Polak-Ribiere
		  3 : positive Polak-Ribiere (beta = max{beta,0})

and you need to change 'fcn.f' to calculate the function and gradient for the
particular function you want to minimize.
		  
Then all you need to do to run the code is type 'make' and then return at the 
prompt to compile and link the code.  Then type 'main' at the prompt to execute
the code.  

Notes
-----

Version 1.1 is identical to version 1.0 except for 2 small bugs which were 
corrected from version 1.0 and some updated comments.
 
1) The variable 'lp' was declared twice in main.f in version 1.0.
2) The variable 'FINISH' was not declared as logical in cgfam.f in version 1.0.
3) The comments indicating the link to the NEOS CG+ solver were updated.
