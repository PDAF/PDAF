!>  Main driver for PDAF tutorial (without assimilation)
!!
!! This is a simple model program to demonstrate the
!! fully-parallel implementation of the online mode of PDAF. 
!!
!! The simple model has a 2-dimensional grid. The initial state
!! is read from a file. The time stepping consists in shifting
!! the field vertically (in the direction of the first array index)
!! by one grid point per time step. A period boundary condition is
!! applied by inserting the field from the upper boundary into the
!! lower one.
