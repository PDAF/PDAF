! !ROUTINE: prepoststep_pdaf - Routine controlling ensemble integration for PDAF
!
! !INTERFACE:
SUBROUTINE prepoststep_pdaf(step, dim_p, dim_ens, dim_ens_p, dim_obs_p, &
     state_p, Uinv, ens_p, flag)

! !DESCRIPTION:
! User-supplied routine for PDAF (all filters).
!
! This variant is used with the simplified interface of
! PDAF. In this case, the name of the routine is defined
! within PDAF. This routine just calls the prepoststep
! routine corresponding to the selected filter algorithm.
!
! !REVISION HISTORY:
! 2010-07 - Lars Nerger - Initial code
! Later revisions - see svn log
!
! !USES:
  USE mod_assimilation, & ! Variables for assimilation
       ONLY: filtertype

  IMPLICIT NONE

! !ARGUMENTS:
  INTEGER, INTENT(in) :: step        ! Current time step
     ! (When the routine is called before the analysis -step is provided.)
  INTEGER, INTENT(in) :: dim_p       ! PE-local state dimension
  INTEGER, INTENT(in) :: dim_ens     ! Size of state ensemble
  INTEGER, INTENT(in) :: dim_ens_p   ! PE-local size of ensemble
  INTEGER, INTENT(in) :: dim_obs_p   ! PE-local dimension of observation vector
  REAL, INTENT(inout) :: state_p(dim_p) ! PE-local forecast/analysis state
  ! The array 'state_p' is not generally not initialized in the case of SEIK.
  ! It can be used freely here.
  REAL, INTENT(inout) :: Uinv(dim_ens-1, dim_ens-1) ! Inverse of matrix U
  REAL, INTENT(inout) :: ens_p(dim_p, dim_ens)      ! PE-local state ensemble
  INTEGER, INTENT(in) :: flag        ! PDAF status flag
