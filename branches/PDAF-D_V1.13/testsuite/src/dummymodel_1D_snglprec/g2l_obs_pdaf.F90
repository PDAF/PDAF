! !ROUTINE: g2l_obs_pdaf --- Restrict an obs. vector to local analysis domain
!
! !INTERFACE:
SUBROUTINE g2l_obs_pdaf(domain, step, dim_obs_f, dim_obs_l, mstate_f, &
     mstate_l)

! !DESCRIPTION:
! User-supplied routine for PDAF.
! Used in the filters: LSEIK/LETKF/LESTKF
!
! The routine is called during the analysis step
! on each of the local analysis domains.
! It has to restrict the full vector of all 
! observations required for the loop of localized 
! analyses on the PE-local domain to the current 
! local analysis domain.
!
! This routine is called by all filter processes.
!
! Implementation for the dummy model with domain
! decomposition. In this variant a local observation 
! domain is used that is defined by the cut-off 
! distance lseik\_range around the current grid
! point that is updated.
!
! !REVISION HISTORY:
! 2007-10 - Lars Nerger - Initial code
! Later revisions - see svn log
