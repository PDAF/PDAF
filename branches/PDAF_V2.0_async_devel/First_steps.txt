First steps with PDAF

When you have downloaded PDAF, a good starting point is to run a
tutorial example. The directory /tutorial contains files for a tutorial
demonstrating the application of PDAF with a simple 2-dimensional example.

Please see the web site http://pdaf.awi.de/trac/wiki/FirstSteps 
for hints on getting started with PDAF.
