! !ROUTINE: collect_state_pdaf --- Initialize state vector from model fields
!
! !INTERFACE:
SUBROUTINE collect_state_pdaf(dim, state)

! !DESCRIPTION:
! User-supplied routine for PDAF (all filters):
!
! This subroutine is called during the forecast
! phase from PDAF\_put\_state\_X after the
! propagation of each ensemble member.
! The supplied state vector has to be initialized
! from the model fields (typically via a module).
! With parallelization, MPI communication might be
! required to initialize state vectors for all
! subdomains on the model PEs.
!
! The routine is executed by each process that is
! participating in the model integrations.
!
! This variant is for the Lorenz05b model without
! parallelization. Here, the state vector
! and the model field are identical. Here, the
! model field is just copied to the state vector.
!
! !REVISION HISTORY:
! 2009-11 - Lars Nerger - Initial code
! Later revisions - see svn log

! !USES:
  USE mod_model, &
       ONLY: x

  IMPLICIT NONE

! !ARGUMENTS:
  INTEGER, INTENT(in) :: dim           ! PE-local state dimension
  REAL, INTENT(inout) :: state(dim)  ! local state vector
