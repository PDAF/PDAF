! !ROUTINE: PDAF_diag_effsample --- Compute effective sample size
!
! !INTERFACE:
  SUBROUTINE PDAF_diag_effsample(dim_sample, weights, n_eff)

! !DESCRIPTION:
! This routine computes the effective sample size of a particle
! filter as defined in Doucet et al. 2001 p. 333

! 2014-06 - Paul Kirchgessner - Initial code for SANGOMA 
! 2016-08 - L. Nerger - adaption for PDAF

! !USES:

  IMPLICIT NONE

! !ARGUMENTS:
  INTEGER, INTENT(in)  :: dim_sample         ! Sample size
  REAL, INTENT(in)    :: weights(dim_sample) ! Weights of the samples
  REAL, INTENT(out)   :: n_eff               ! Effecfive sample size
