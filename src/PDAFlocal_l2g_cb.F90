! !ROUTINE: PDAFlocal_l2g_cb - Initialize global vector elements from local state vector
!
! !INTERFACE:
SUBROUTINE PDAFlocal_l2g_cb(step, domain_p, dim_l, state_l, dim_p, state_p)

! !DESCRIPTION:
! Initialize elements of a global state vector from a local state vector.
! This is the full callback function to be used internally. The mapping 
! is done using the index vector id_lstate_in_pstate that is initialize
! in PDAF_local_set_index.
!
! To exclude any element of the local state vector from the initialization
! one can set the corresponding index value to 0.
