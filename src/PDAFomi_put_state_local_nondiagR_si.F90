! !ROUTINE: PDAFomi_put_state_local_nondiagR_si --- Interface to transfer state to PDAF
!
! !INTERFACE:
SUBROUTINE PDAFomi_put_state_local_nondiagR_si(outflag)

! !DESCRIPTION:
! Interface routine called from the model during the 
! forecast of each ensemble state to transfer data
! from the model to PDAF and to perform the analysis
! step.
!
! This routine provides the simplified interface
! where names of user-provided subroutines are
! fixed. It simply calls the routine with the
! full interface using pre-defined routine names.
!
! The routine supports all domain-localized filters.
!
! !  This is a core routine of PDAF and
!    should not be changed by the user   !
