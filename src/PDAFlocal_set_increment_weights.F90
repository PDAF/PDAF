!> Set vector of local increment weights
!!
!! This routine initializes a PDAF_internal local array
!! of increment weights. The weights are applied in 
!! in PDAF_local_l2g_cb, when the global state vector
!! is initialized from the local state vector. These can
!! e.g. be used to apply a vertical localization.
