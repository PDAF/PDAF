! !ROUTINE: PDAFlocal_g2l_cb - Project global to local vector according to index array
!
! !INTERFACE:
SUBROUTINE PDAFlocal_g2l_cb(step, domain_p, dim_p, state_p, dim_l, state_l)

! !DESCRIPTION:
! Project a global to a local state vector for the localized filters.
! This is the full callback function to be used internally. The mapping 
! is done using the index vector id_lstate_in_pstate that is initialize
! in PDAF_local_set_index.
