! !ROUTINE: PDAFomi_put_state_global_si --- Interface to transfer state to PDAF
!
! !INTERFACE:
SUBROUTINE PDAFomi_put_state_global_si(outflag)

! !DESCRIPTION:
! Interface routine called from the model after the 
! forecast of each ensemble state to transfer data
! from the model to PDAF. 
!
! This routine provides the simplified interface
! where names of user-provided subroutines are
! fixed. It simply calls the routine with the
! full interface using pre-defined routine names.
!
! The routine supports all global filters.
!
! !  This is a core routine of PDAF and
!    should not be changed by the user   !
!
! !REVISION HISTORY:
! 2010-07 - Lars Nerger - Initial code
! Later revisions - see svn log

! !USES:
  IMPLICIT NONE
  
! !ARGUMENTS:
  INTEGER, INTENT(inout) :: outflag ! Status flag
  
! ! Names of external subroutines 
  EXTERNAL :: collect_state_pdaf, & ! Routine to collect a state vector
       prepoststep_pdaf             ! User supplied pre/poststep routine
  ! Interface to PDAF-OMI for local and global filters
  EXTERNAL :: &
       init_dim_obs_pdafomi, &       ! Get dimension of full obs. vector for PE-local domain
       obs_op_pdafomi                ! Obs. operator for full obs. vector for PE-local domain
