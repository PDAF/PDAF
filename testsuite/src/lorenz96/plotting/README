Plotting scripts for the Lorenz96 model test case

this directory contains a set of scripts to plot outputs from
the Lorenz96 model with Matlab.

Except for plot_example.m, all script require the specification 
of the directory and name of the file to be read. sometimes, 
there are additional arguments like the time step index. Use
'help' in Matlab to display the information about required input.

The scripts are:

plot_example.m
Plot the mean RMS errors for the example output files generated
with the script tools/runasml.sh

ploteofs.m
Plot the mean state and the eigenvectors (EOFs) from the
file holdig the covariance matrix that is generated with
tools/generate_covar.F90.

plotobs.m
Plot the observations for a specified time step. The observation
file is generated using tolls/generate_obs.F90.

plotrms.m
Plot true and estimated RMS errors from an assimilation experiment.

plotsigma.m
Plot the singular values from the file holdig the covariance
matrix that is generated with tools/generate_covar.F90.

plotstate.m
Plot the state from the file holding a true state trajectory or
the estimated forecast or analysis stats from an assimilation 
experiment.
