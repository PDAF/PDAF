! !ROUTINE: prepoststep_seek --- Used-defined Pre/Poststep routine for PDAF
!
! !INTERFACE:
SUBROUTINE prepoststep_seek(step, dim_p, dim_eof, dim_eof_p, dim_obs_p, &
     state_p, Uinv, eofV_p, flag)

! !DESCRIPTION:
! User-supplied routine for PDAF.
! Used in the filters: SEEK
! 
! The routine is called before the analysis
! and after the re-diagonalization.  Also it 
! is called once at the initial time before 
! any forecasts are computed. 
! The routine provides full access to the state 
! estimate and the state covariance matrix 
! to the user.  Thus, user-controlled pre- and 
! poststep operations can be performed here. 
! For example the forecast and the analysis 
! states and error covariance matrix can be 
! analized, e.g. by computing the estimated 
! variance.  In addition, the estimates can be 
! written to disk.  If a user considers to 
! perform adjustments to the estimates (e.g. 
! for balances), this routine is the right 
! place for it.
!
! The routine is called by all filter processes.
