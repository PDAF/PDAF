! !ROUTINE: init_obs_f_pdaf --- Initialize observation vector
!
! !INTERFACE:
SUBROUTINE init_obs_f_pdaf(step, dim_obs_f, observation_f)

! !DESCRIPTION:
! User-supplied routine for PDAF.
! Used in the filters: LSEIK/LETKF/LESTKF
!
! The routine is called in PDAF\_lseik\_update
! before the loop over all local analysis domains
! is entered. It has to provide the full observation 
! vector according to current time step (where 'full' 
! means 'all observations required for the localized 
! analysis on the PE-local domain).  This routine 
! is only used for LSEIK if a globally adaptive 
! forgetting factor is requested, rather than an 
! individual forgetting factor for each analysis 
! domain. This routine has to be implemented 
! consistently with the routines for the full 
! observation dimension and the full observation 
! operator. The forgetting factor will only be 
! globally adaptive, if the full observation vector 
! is the global observation vector.
!
! The routine is called by all filter processes.
