!> Interface to PDAF for global filter for fully-parallel implementation
!!
!! Interface routine called from the model at each time
!! step during the forecast of each ensemble state. If
!! the time of the next analysis step is reached the
!! analysis is computed by calling PDAF_put_state_GLOBALTEMPLATE.
!! Subsequently, PDAF_get_state is called to initialize
!! the next forecast phase. 
!!
!! The code is generic. The only filter-specific part is
!! the call to the routine PDAF\_put\_state\_X where the
!! analysis is computed. The filter-specific call-back subroutines 
!! are specified in the calls to the two core routines.
!!
!! ADAPTING THE TEMPLATE:
!! When implementing a filter, the only required changes to this routine
!! should be
!! - replace 'GLOBALTEMPLATE' by the name of the new method
!! - potentially adapt the argument lists in PDAF\_assimilate\_GLOBALTEMPLATE
!!   and PDAF\_put\_state\_GLOBALTEMPLATE
!!
