This directory is part od PDAF - the Parallel Data Assimilation Framework.
It contains an implementations of the offline and online modes of PDAF
with a simple 2-dimensional model setup.

The implementation is described in detail in the tutorials that are available
on the web site of PDAF (http://pdaf.awi.de).

The directories are as follows:

---- Input files ----

inputs_offline/
This directory contains input files to execute the example programs for the
offline mode of PDAF.

inputs_online/
This directory contains input files to execute the example programs for the
online mode of PDAF.


---- OFFLINE mode ----

offline_2D_serial/
contains an implementation of the offline mode without parallelization support.

offline_2D_openmp/
contains an implementation of the offline mode in which the local filters use
OpenMP parallelization.

offline_2D_parallel/
contains an implementation of the offline mode with MPI-parallelization. Thus,
the exmaple can be run with multiple processors. Required is an MPI library
like OpenMPI.


---- ONLINE mode ----

online_2d_serialmodel/
contains an implementation of the online mode of PDAF with a serial 
(i.e. non-parallelized) model.  Only the ensemble integration is performed
in parallel, while each model and the filter are each executed using a 
single process.

online_2d_serialmodel_openmp/
contains an implementation of the online mode of PDAF with a serial
(i.e. non-parallelized) model.  The ensemble integration is performed
in parallel, while each model is executed using a single process. The 
local filters are executed using the OpenMP-parallelization.

online_2D_parallelmodel/
contains an implementation of the online mode of PDAF with a parallelized 
model.  In this case, both the model and the filter are parallelized. Also,
the ensemble integration can be performed in parallel
This case can be run e.g. with
	mpirun -np 18 ./model_pdaf -n_modeltasks 9
(Thus, we use 3 mdoel tasks of each 2 processes. The processes of model 
task 1 are also used to compute the filter.)


---- ONLINE mode - special cases with separate processes for model and filter ----

online_2D_parallelmodel_fullpar/
As online_2D_parallelmodel, this directory contains an implementation of the 
online mode of PDAF with a parallelized model.
This variant uses a particular configuration in which the filter is executed
using different processes than the models. Thus all ensemble members are
exchanged between the model tasks and the filter processes using MPI
communication.
This case can be run e.g. with
	mpirun -np 20 ./model_pdaf -n_modeltasks 9
(Thus, we use 9 model tasks of each 2 processes. Another 2 processes are used
for the filter.) 
The routines are identical to those of online_2D_fullpar, except for main_pdaf.F90
and init_parallel_pdaf.F90.  In the latter routine, the initialization of the
MPI communicators is changed so that the filter uses a set of processes that is
distinct from the proceses running the model. In main_pdaf.F90 the subroutine calls
for the filter processes are separated from those for the model processes to 
more clearly show which parts are run by which processes. 

online_2D_parallelmodel_fullpar_1fpe/
As online_2d_parallelmodel, this directory contains an implementation of the
online mode of PDAF with a parallelized model.
This variant uses a particular configuration in which the filter is executed
on a single process which is different from the processes that compute the
model integrations. Thus, the number of processes for the filter and each model
task are distinct. 
This case can be run e.g. with
   mpirun -np 19 ./model_pdaf -n_modeltasks 9
(Thus, we use 3 model tasks of each 2 processes. One further processes is used
for the filter.)
The routines are identical to those of online_2D_fullpar, except for main_pdaf.F90,
init_parallel_pdaf.F90, distribute_state_pdaf.F90, and collect_state_pdaf.F90.  
In init_parallel_pdaf.F90, the initialization of the
MPI communicators is changed so that the filter uses a single processes which is
distinct from the proceses running the model. This setup is analogous to that
used in oneline_2D_parallelmodel_fullpar, except for using a single process here.
The routine main_pdaf.F90 is identical to that used in online_2D_parallelmodel_fullpar.
As in the configuration the filter uses only a single process, while the model 
integrations are each parallelized, only the model processes with rank 0 
communicate directory with the filter process. To account for this particularity,
the routine distribute_state_pdaf.F90 is changed so that it distributes the global 
state vector over the model processes of each model task so that each model
process initialized the field in its local sub-domain. Analogously, the routine
collect_state_pdaf.F90 dist collects a global state vector on each model process
with rank 0.
