! !ROUTINE: prodRinvA_pdaf --- Compute product of inverse of R with some matrix
!
! !INTERFACE:
SUBROUTINE prodRinvA_pdaf(step, dim_obs_p, rank, obs_p, A_p, C_p)

! !DESCRIPTION:
! User-supplied routine for PDAF.
! Used in the filters: SEEK/SEIK/ETKF/ESTKF
!
! The routine is called during the analysis step.
! It has to compute the product of the inverse of 
! the observation error covariance matrix with
! the matrix of observed EOF modes (SEEK) or 
! observed ensemble perturbations (SEIK/ETKF/ESTKF).
!
! This routine is called by all filter processes.
!
! !REVISION HISTORY:
! 2004-10 - Lars Nerger - Initial code
! Later revisions - see svn log

! !USES:
  IMPLICIT NONE

! !ARGUMENTS:
  INTEGER, INTENT(in) :: step                ! Current time step
  INTEGER, INTENT(in) :: dim_obs_p           ! PE-local dimension of obs. vector
  INTEGER, INTENT(in) :: rank                ! Rank of initial covariance matrix
