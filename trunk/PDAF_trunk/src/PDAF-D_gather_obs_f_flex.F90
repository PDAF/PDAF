! !ROUTINE: PDAF_gather_obs_f_flex --- Gather a full observation vector
!
! !INTERFACE:
SUBROUTINE PDAF_gather_obs_f_flex(dim_obs_p, dim_obs_f, obs_p, obs_f, status)

! !DESCRIPTION:
! If the local filter is used with a domain-decomposed model,
! the observational information from different sub-domains
! has to be combined into the full observation vector. 
! In this routine the process-local parts of the observation
! vector are gathered into a full observation vector. 
! The routine requires that PDAF_gather_dim_obs_f was executed
! before, because this routine initializes dimensions that are 
! used here. 
! The routine can also be used to gather full arrays of coordinates.
! It is however, only usable if the coordinates are stored row-
! wise, i.e. each row represents the set of coordinates for one
! observation point. It has to be called separately for each column. 
! A  better alternative is the row-wise storage of coordinates. In this
! case the routine PDAF_gather_dim_obs_f allows the gather the full
! coordinate array in one step.
!
! !  This is a core routine of PDAF and
!    should not be changed by the user   !
