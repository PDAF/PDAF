! !ROUTINE: PDAF_allreduce --- Perform an allreduce in COMM_filter
!
! !INTERFACE:
SUBROUTINE PDAF_allreduce(val_p, val_g, mpitype, mpiop, status)

! !DESCRIPTION:
! If the local filter is used with a domain-decomposed model,
! the observational information from different sub-domains
! has to be combined into the full observation vector. 
! This routine is called as a first step to compute the
! full observation dimension from the process-local
! observation dimensions.
! Practically, the operation is a simple MPI_Allreduce. This
! is encapsulated here to simplify the operation for the users. 
! In addition an array storing the pe-local observation dimensions
! and an array of displacements for gathering are initialized.
!
! !  This is a core routine of PDAF and
!    should not be changed by the user   !
!
! !REVISION HISTORY:
! 2019-03 - Lars Nerger - Initial code
! Later revisions - see svn log
!
! !USES:
! Include definitions for real type of different precision
! (Defines BLAS/LAPACK routines and MPI_REALTYPE)
