! !ROUTINE: PDAF_generate_obs --- Interface to PDAF for observation generation
!
! !INTERFACE:
SUBROUTINE PDAF_generate_obs(U_collect_state, U_distribute_state, &
     U_init_dim_obs_f, U_obs_op_f, U_init_obserr_f, U_get_obs_f, &
     U_prepoststep, U_next_observation, outflag)

! !DESCRIPTION:
! Interface routine called from the model at each time
! step during the forecast of each ensemble state. If
! the time of the next analysis step is reached the
! forecast state is transferred to PDAF and observations
! are generated according to the observation operator
! and by adding Gaussian random noise. Subsequently, 
! PDAF_get_state is called to initialize the next forecast
! phase. 
!
! !  This is a core routine of PDAF and
!    should not be changed by the user   !
!
