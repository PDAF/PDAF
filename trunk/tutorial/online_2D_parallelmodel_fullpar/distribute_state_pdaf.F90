!>  Initialize model fields from state vector
!!
!! User-supplied call-back routine for PDAF.
!!
!! Used in all filters.
!!
!! During the forecast phase of the filter this
!! subroutine is called from PDAF_get_state
!! supplying a model state which has to be evolved. 
!! The routine has to initialize the fields of the 
!! model (typically available through a module) from 
!! the state vector of PDAF. With parallelization, 
!! MPI communication might be required to 
!! initialize all subdomains on the model PEs.
!!
!! The routine is executed by each process that is
!! participating in the model integrations.
!!
!! For the 2D tutorial model the state vector and
!! the model field are identical. Hence, the field
!! array is directly initialized from an ensemble 
!! state vector by each model PE.
