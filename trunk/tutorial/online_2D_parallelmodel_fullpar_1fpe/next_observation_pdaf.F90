!>  Initialize information on next observation
!!
!! User-supplied call-back routine for PDAF.
!!
!! Used in all filters
!!
!! The subroutine is called before each forecast phase
!! by PDAF_get_state. It has to initialize the number 
!! of time steps until the next available observation 
!! (nsteps) and the current model time (time). In 
!! addition the exit flag (exit) has to be initialized.
!! It indicates if the data assimilation process is 
!! completed such that the ensemble loop in the model 
!! routine can be exited.
!!
!! The routine is called from PDAF_get_state by all processes
!!         
!! Version for the 2D tutorial model.
