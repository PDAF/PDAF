! !ROUTINE: init_ens_pdaf --- Initialize ensemble for SEIK
!
! !INTERFACE:
SUBROUTINE init_ens_pdaf(filtertype, dim, dim_ens, state, Uinv, &
     ens, flag)

! !DESCRIPTION:
! User-supplied routine for PDAF (all filters):
!
! The routine is called when the filter is
! initialized in PDAF\_filter\_init.  It has
! to initialize an ensemble of dim\_ens model 
! states. Here, we supply three methods to 
! initialize the ensemble:
! eof - By second-order exact sampling. 
!       This follows Pham (2001) and was used
!       in most of our papers.
! rnd - By random sampling form a long state
!       trajectory. This method is often described
!       In papers on the EnKF and the ensemble
!       square-root filters.
! tru - This variant is only used when synthetic
!       observation are generated. In this case
!       all ensemble states are equal.
!
! This version is for the Lorenz05c model
! without parallelization.

! !ARGUMENTS:
  INTEGER, INTENT(in) :: filtertype          ! Type of filter to initialize
  INTEGER, INTENT(in) :: dim                 ! PE-local state dimension
  INTEGER, INTENT(in) :: dim_ens             ! Size of ensemble
  REAL, INTENT(inout) :: state(dim)          ! PE-local model state
  ! It is not necessary to initialize the array 'state' for SEIK. 
  ! It is available here only for convenience and can be used freely.
!  REAL, INTENT(inout) :: Uinv(dim_ens-1,dim_ens-1) ! Array not referenced for SEIK
  REAL, INTENT(inout) :: Uinv(1,1) ! Array not referenced for SEIK
  REAL, INTENT(out)   :: ens(dim, dim_ens)   ! PE-local state ensemble
  INTEGER, INTENT(inout) :: flag             ! PDAF status flag
